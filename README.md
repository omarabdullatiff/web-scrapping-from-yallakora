# Match Center Scraper ‚öΩ

This is a simple Python script that helps you scrape match details (like team names, scores, and match times) from the **Yallakora Match Center** website for a specific date. It then saves all the data into a neat CSV file for you to analyze or share.

## What Does It Do? 

- **Fetches Match Details**: Give it a date, and it will grab all the match details for that day.
- **Extracts Useful Info**: It pulls out the championship name, team names, scores, and match times.
- **Saves to CSV**: All the data is saved into a CSV file (`matches_details.csv`) so you can open it in Excel, Google Sheets, or any other tool.

## What Do You Need? üõ†Ô∏è

Before you start, make sure you have these installed:
- **Python 3.x** (because Python 2 is so last decade üòâ)
- These Python libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `csv`.
